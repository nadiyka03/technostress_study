# technostress_study
 This repository contains a study on the influence of various variables on job performance and job satisfaction, exploring the impact of technostress on data scientists by measuring the effect of ICTs on job performance and job satisfaction.
With the rapid integration of information and communication technologies (ICTs) into the workplace, employees face new stressors that can impact their well-being and job performance. Our study aimed to explore these effects by examining the correlation between technostress factors—such as Usefulness, Conflicts, Insecurity, Overload, and Unreliability—and job satisfaction and performance.
We developed and distributed a survey among data scientists working in Germany to gather relevant data. The responses were analyzed to identify any significant correlations and to see if the results differed by gender.
The results of this study are presented in this report, offering an analysis of the effects of technostress on data scientists in Germany.
